# Environment Validation and Type System Dependencies

## Critical Path Discovery

We've identified a critical relationship between environment validation and TypeScript type definitions:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Node.js Installation] --> B[PATH Configuration]
    B --> C[npm Command Access]
    C --> D[Type Definition Installation]
    D --> E[TypeScript Resolution]
    B -.-> F[Development Tools]
    F -.-> G[IDE Integration]
```

## Validation Chain

1. **Installation Detection**
   - Primary: Start Menu entries
   - Secondary: Program Files locations
   - Tertiary: User-specific installations

2. **PATH Configuration**
   - System PATH validation
   - User PATH validation
   - Runtime command accessibility

3. **Type System Dependencies**
   - Node.js core types (@types/node)
   - Testing framework types (@types/jest)
   - Framework-specific types (@types/react)

## Impact on Development Pipeline

1. **Environment Checker**
   - `environment-checker.ts`: Validates runtime environment
   - `nodejs-validation.ps1`: Ensures Node.js availability
   - Integration with type system validation

2. **Bootstrap Process**
   - `bootstrap.ps1`: Initial setup coordination
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Type definition installation

3. **Development Experience**
   - IDE type recognition
   - IntelliSense functionality
   - Build process validation

## Best Practices

1. **Installation Validation**
   - Check multiple installation locations
   - Verify PATH configuration
   - Test command availability

2. **Type System Setup**
   - Validate type definition installation
   - Verify TypeScript configuration
   - Test type resolution

3. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages
   - Actionable fix suggestions
   - Automated repair when possible

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment-Type Coupling**

   - Installation location impacts tool availability

2. **Validation Strategy**
   - Progressive validation (installation → PATH → types)
   - Multiple validation points
   - Comprehensive error reporting

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Clear dependency chains
