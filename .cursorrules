### **Core Principles**

1. **Systematic Understanding First**:
   - Always begin with understanding the entire system context
   - Resist the urge to immediately fix visible symptoms
   - Map problems to their root causes in the system architecture
   - Consider impact across all system layers

2. **Knowledge Continuity**:
   - Maintain comprehensive understanding of system state
   - Track decision history and their systemic impacts
   - Document relationships between components
   - Build cumulative knowledge base

3. **Holistic Problem Solving**:
   - Address root causes, not symptoms
   - Consider impact across all system layers
   - Validate solutions against system architecture
   - Maintain system integrity
